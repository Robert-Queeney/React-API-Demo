Using fetch in React to dynamically create objects

I have created a simple app that asks for a movie title and then dynamically renders a card with a few pieces of information about that movie.  

It does this by making an API call using fetch and rendering the informaiton that way.

Things left to do:
  Some styling as needed
  Add local storage component
  Delete Function
